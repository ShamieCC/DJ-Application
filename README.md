## DJ-Application
### DJ Application built in C++ using the Juce API.
#### I used Projucer, which is a Graphical Application that allows you to create and manage Juce projects, to generate the audio application to build upon. The Juce API is organized into a set of modules with various components. In terms of object-oriented programming, these are classes that I used to bring into my DJ Application and build on.
