## DJ-Application
### DJ Application built in C++ using the Juce API.
#### I used Projucer, which is a Graphical Application that allows you to create and manage Juce projects, to generate the audio application for me to build upon. The Juce API is organised into a set of modules with various components. In terms of Object Oriented programming, these are classes that I used to to bring into my DJ Application and build on.
